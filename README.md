## Repository for one my [Neocities websites](https://cozyglow.neocities.org/)
This is the first repository I've ever made on Github, so, it was originally a test reps. to see if I could get Neocities and Github to work together, and now that it does, It's the definitive repository for https://cozyglow.neocities.org/.
